Use to ensure that end-user provided HTML contains only the elements and attributes that you are expecting; no junk, and no cross-site scripting attacks! The HTML cleaner parses the input as HTML and then runs it through a white-list, so the output HTML can only contain HTML that is allowed by the whitelist. It is assumed that the input HTML is a body fragment; the clean methods only pull from the source's body, and the canned white-lists only allow body contained tags. Rather than interacting directly with a Cleaner object, generally see the clean methods in Jsoup.
